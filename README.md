# FileAuditing
Ransomware - Pro-active Measures - FileAuditing

I envisioned this project to tackle ransomware by detecting infection rate in a pro-active manner. 
The goal here is to audit file patterns during the time of ransomware execution. This utility will enable the ability to detect patterns when there is a bulk creation and deletion of files while the ransomware is execution.
